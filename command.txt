 Principles of Distributed Systems:
Distributed Systems refer to a collection of independent computers that work together as a single system to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently. These systems coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.
Client-Server Architecture:
Client-Server Architecture is a model where multiple clients (users or devices) request and receive services from a centralized server. The server provides resources or services, and the clients use them.
Concurrent Programming:
Concurrent Programming involves designing programs that can execute multiple tasks simultaneously, making efficient use of system resources like CPU and memory.
Modern Frameworks (gRPC and Protocol Buffers):
gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for making remote procedure calls (RPC). It allows a client application to call methods on a server application as if it were a local object.
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. It is useful in communication protocols, data storage, and more.
Building and Managing a Scalable and Efficient Token Management System:
Scalable System: A system that can handle increasing amounts of work by adding resources (e.g., more servers).
Efficient System: A system that maximizes performance while minimizing resource usage.
Token Management System: A system that manages the creation, updating, reading, and deletion of tokens, which are data structures with specific properties.
